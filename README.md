## Content Insights
I learned the steps to building a website, including choosing a free plan, customizing the theme, and adding various sections (e.g., headers, images, galleries) to create a visually appealing site. I learned the importance of using a site editor to modify text, images, and other elements, as well as showing how to add articles and pages, and categorize and tag them for organization. Ultimately, I understood that the entire process of building a website can be completed by saving progress, publishing the site, and updating the navigation.

Then, I also learned about the main web design languages and planning a project using a site map. This highlighted consistency in design style, effective use of visual elements such as animation and color, and useful tools such as site builders and templates. I understood the importance of user-centered considerations, including mobile responsiveness and clear calls to action.In addition, it is important to join the web design community for collaboration and continuous improvement.

Finally, I learned how to use Ngrok to publish a local server to a public network address. After downloading and extracting Ngrok on Windows, start the server with the command "ngrok.exe http 80". Copy the forwarding link provided by Ngrok and open it in your browser to access the local server remotely. Navigate to the local directory where the web files are stored (e.g., the htdocs folder in XAMPP). Open the desired file or project in a browser using the provided URL to access its local host via the public URL.




## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Firstly, by learning the process of building a website, I gained a wealth of practical experience and skills that will play a key role in my future career. Then, I learned to choose the right free plan, customize the theme of the website, and add various elements to give the website an impressive appearance. This process taught me to create a complete website by using a website editor to modify elements such as text and images, as well as managing categories and tags for posts and pages.

Secondly, understanding the major web design languages and using a sitemap to plan a project gave me a deeper understanding of consistency in design style, effective use of visual elements, and the use of site building tools and templates. This will help me to better participate in web development projects and improve my design skills in the future.

Additionally, learning to use Ngrok to publish a local server to a public web address has provided me with the convenience of testing and presenting local projects. This will speed up the development and debugging process of projects and increase productivity in future work, especially when working with a team.

Overall, these learnings have not only provided me with practical technical skills, but also developed problem solving, teamwork and creative thinking skills. In my future career, I look forward to applying this knowledge and participating in more complex and challenging projects to continuously enhance my professionalism in the field of web design and development. At the same time, I recognize that being a part of the web design community is an integral part of the process, which will provide me with opportunities to network, learn, and continually improve, advancing my long-term growth in the industry.
